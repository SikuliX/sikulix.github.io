## Class/instance methods

Generally you have the choice between using the class methods (e.g. ``App.open("application-identifier"``)) or first create an App instance and use the instance methods afterwards (e.g. ``myApp = App("application-identifier"``) and then later on ``myApp.open()``). There is no recomendation for a preferred usage, but if you plan to act on the same app or window more often, it might be more efficient, to use the instance approach.

For the string ``application-identifier`` principally the same rules apply, as if you would use the identifier on a command line. Especially if path specification contains blanks, it must be enclosed in double-quotes.

If the application name is given without a path specification, then it must be found on the system, according to the rules of that system (Windows: is on system path, Mac: is in an /Applications folder, …).

Examples:

```python Python scripting
myApp = App("someApp")
myApp = App("/myapps/someApp.app")
myApp = App(r"c:\myapps\someApp.exe")
myApp = App(r'"c:\folder with spaces\someApp.exe"')
myApp = App('"c:\\folder with spaces\\someApp.exe"')
```
```java
myApp = App("\"c:\\folder with spaces\\someApp.exe\"")
```

#### How to create an App instance

The basic choice is to just say ```someApp = App("some-app-identifier")``` and you have your app instance, that you can later use together with its methods, without having to specify the string again.

Generally all class methods return an app instance, that you might save in a variable to use it later in your script.

At time of instance creation the process list is scanned for the name of the executable using the given text. If this is found, the app instance is initialized with the respective information (PID, executable, window title of main/frontmost window). So you could directly ask the app instance, wether it is running (```isRunning()```), has a main window (```hasWindow()```), get the title of that main window (```getWindow()```) and get the process id (PID) (getPID).

The string representation of an app instance looks like this:
```[nPID:executableName (main/frontmost window title)] given text```

:::important
The ```application-identifier``` can no longer be (part of) a window title - it must specify an executable. If you want to reference a running application with (part of) a window title, you have to use ```App.focus()```.

:::note
Currently the information, wether a window is hidden or minimized, is not available and it is not possible yet, to bring such a window to front with a compound SikuliX feature.

## Handling Applications

Open, close an application or focus on it

**class App**

- **classmethod App(application)**
   - Usage: ```someApp = App(application)```

   Create an App instance, to later use with the instance methods.
   The string application must allow the system to locate the application in the system specific mannor. If this is not possible you might try the full path to an application’s executable.
   Optionally you might add parameters, that will be given to the application at time of open.

   There are 3 options:
      put the application string in apostrophes and the rest following the second apostroph will be taken as parameter string
      put `` `` – `` `` (space 2 hyphens! space) between the applications name or path (no apostrophes!) and the parameter string.
      use ```setUsing()``` with an already existing application object

   - Parameters:	application – The name of an application (case-insensitive) or the path to the executable and optionally parameters
   - Returns:	an ``App`` object, that can be used with the instance methods

- **classmethod open(application)**
   - Usage: ``App.open(application)``

   Open the specified application, if it is not yet opened and bring it to front

   - Parameters:	application – the same as for App(application
   - Returns:	an App object, that can be used with the instance methods

   This method is functionally equivalent to ```openApp()```.

**classmethod focus(title[, index])**
   - Usage: ``App.focus(title [, index])``

   Switch the input focus to a running application having a front-most window with a matching title.

   - Parameters:	
      title – The name of an application (case-insensitive) or (part of) a window title (case-sensitive).
      index – optional number (counting from 0) telling which one you want to have in the row of possible matches.
   - Returns:	
      an App object, that can be used with the instance methods

   If no index is given, it is taken as 0. If the index is not applicable (not enough matches) the returned App object is invalid and not useable.

   So you might loop through possible matches by counting the index up from 0 until you get an invalid

   If you specify the exact window title of an open window, you will get exactly this one. But if you specify some text, that is found in more than one open window title, you will get the first in the row of all these windows. So if you want exactly one specific window, you either need to know the exact window title or at least some part of the title text, that makes this window unique in the current context (e.g. save a document with a specific name, before accessing it’s window).

   macOS and Linux not yet possible, to identify a running app by part of the title of it’s frontmost window. If you want to use a window title to match the application, use ``App.focus()`` before, to get a valid App object.

   This method is functionally equivalent to ``switchApp()``.

- **classmethod close(application)**
   - Usage: App.close(application)

   It closes the running application matching the given string. It does nothing if no running application matches. If you want to use a window title to match the application, use ``App.focus()`` before, to get a valid App object.

   - Parameters:	application – The name of an application (case-insensitive)
   
   This method is functionally equivalent to ``closeApp()``.

- **setUsing(parametertext)**
   - Usage: appName = someApp.setUsing("parm1 x parm2 y parm3 z") where App instance someApp was created before.

   - Parameters:	parametertext – a string, that is given to the application at startup (when using open() ) as if you would start the app from a commandline.

- **setWorkDir([workingFolder])**
   WINDOWS ONLY
   - Usage: ``appName = someApp.setWorkDir("path to the working directory")`` where App instance someApp was created before.

   - Param workingFolder:
 	   the absolute path, which gets the working directory. The location of the app exec-file is used if omitted.

- **open([waitTime])**
   - Usage: ```someApp.open()``` where App instance ```someApp``` was created before.

   Open this application.

   - Parameters:	waitTime – optional: seconds as integer, that should be waited for the app to get running 
   - Returns:	the app instance, which will be invalid, if open failed.

- **focus()**
   - Usage: ```someApp.focus()``` where ``App`` instance ```someApp``` was created before.

   Switch the input focus to this application.

   - Returns:	the app instance, which will be invalid, if open failed.

- **close([waitTime])**
   - Usage: ```someApp.close()``` where ``App`` instance ``someApp`` was created before.

   Close this application.

   - Parameters:	waitTime – optional: seconds as integer, that should be waited for the app to no longer being running
   - Returns:	the app instance, which should be invalid (not running) afterwards.

- **closeByKey([waitTime])**
   - Usage: ```someApp.closeByKey()``` where ``App`` instance ``someApp`` was created before.

   Close this application by bringing it to front first (```focus()``) an then issue the systemspecific keybord shortcut to close an application. This might help in situations where the normal ``close()`` leads to oddities at a later restart of the application.

   - Parameters:	waitTime – optional: seconds as integer, that should be waited for the app to no longer being running

##### Getting information about a running application

- **isValid()**
   - Usage: if not ``someApp.isValid(): someApp.open()`` where App instance someApp was created before.

   - Returns:	True if the app has a process ID, False otherwise
   Be aware This simply checks wether the app object has a valid process ID. Hence it returns instantly. But there is no guarantee, that the app is still running. If you want to be sure, you have to use isRunning(0), which evaluates the state of the app, but might take some 100 millisecs, depending on your system’s state.

- **isRunning([waitTime])**
   - Usage: if not ``someApp.isRunning(): someApp.open()`` where App instance someApp was created before.

   - Parameters:	waitTime – optional: seconds as integer, that should be waited for the app to get running
   - Returns:	True if the app is running (has a process ID), False otherwise
   Be aware Until the wait time is elapsed, the state of the application is checked every second. If you use just ``isRunning()``, the state check is done twice, waiting 1 second in between. Hence this might take up to 2 seconds. If you want, that only one check is done, use isRunning(0).

- **hasWindow()**
   - Usage: if not ``someApp.hasWindow(): openNewWindow()`` # some private function where App instance someApp was created before.

   - Returns:	True if the app is running and has a main window registered, False otherwise

- **getTitle()**
   - Usage: ``title = someApp.getTitle()`` where App instance someApp was created before.

   - Returns:	the ``title`` of the frontmost window of this application, might be an empty string

- **getPID()**
   - Usage: ``pid = someApp.getPID()`` where App instance someApp was created before.

   - Returns:	the process ID as number if app is running, -1 otherwise

- **getName()**
   - Usage: ``appName = someApp.getName()`` where App instance someApp was created before.

   - Returns:	the short name of the app as it is shown in the process list

- **classmethod pause(waitTime)**
   - Usage: ``App.pause(someTime)`` (convenience function)

   Just do nothing for the given amount of time in seconds (integer or float).

  ### Dealing with Application windows

- **classmethod focusedWindow()**
   - Usage: ``App.focusedWindow()``

   Identify the currently focused or the frontmost window and switch to it. SikuliX does not tell you, to which application this window belongs.

   - Returns:	a Region object representing the window or None if there is no such window.
   
   ***On Mac***, when starting a script, Sikuli hides its window and starts processing the script. In this moment, no window has focus. Thus, it is necessary to first click somewhere or use ``App.focus()`` to focus on a window. In this case, this method may return None.

   On ***Windows***, this method always returns a region. When there is no window opened on the desktop, the region may refer to a special window such as the task bar or an icon in the system tray.

   Example:

   ```code
   # highlight the currently fontmost window for 2 seconds
   App.focusedWindow().highlight(2)

   # save the windows region before
   firstWindow = App.focusedWindow()
   firstWindow.highlight(2)
   ```

- **window([n])**
   - Usage 1: ``App(application).window([n])`` an App instance is created on the fly.

   - Usage 2: ``someApp.window([n])`` where App instance someApp was created before.

   Get the region corresponding to the n-th window of this application (Mac) or a series of windows with the matching title (Windows/Linux).

   - Parameters:	n – 0 or a positive integer number. If ommitted, 0 is taken as default.
   - Returns:	the region on the screen occupied by the window, if such window exists and None if otherwise.

   Below is an example that tries to open a Firefox browser window and switches to the address field (Windows):

   ```code
   # using an existing window if possible
   myApp = App("Firefox")
   if not myApp.window(): # no window(0) - Firefox not open
         App.open("c:\\Program Files\\Mozilla Firefox\\Firefox.exe")
         wait(2)
   myApp.focus()
   wait(1)
   type("l", KEY_CTRL) # switch to address field
   ```

   Afterwards, it focuses on the Firefox application, uses the ``window()`` method to obtain the region of the frontmost window, applies some operations within the region, and finally closes the window:

   ```code
   # using a new window
   firefox = App.open("c:\\Program Files\\Mozilla Firefox\\Firefox.exe");
   wait(2)
   firefox.focus()
   wait(1)
   # now your just opened new window should be the frontmost
   with Region(firefox.window()): # see the general notes below
         # some actions inside the window(0)'s region
         click("somebutton.png")
   firefox.close() # close the window - stop the process
   ```
   
   Below is another example that highlights all the windows of an application by looping through them (Mac):

   ```code
   # not more than 100 windows should be open ;-)
   myApp = App("Safari")
   for n in range(100):
         w = myApp.window(n)
         if not w: break # no more windows
         w.highlight(2) # window highlighted for 2 second
   ```

- **getTitle([n])**
   - Usage: see ``App.window([n])``

   - Returns:	the title of the frontmost/nth window of this application, might be an empty string

## General Tips

- Be aware, that especially the window handling feature is experimental and under further development.

- Especially on Windows be aware, that there might be many matching windows and windows, that might not be visible at all. Currently the ``window()`` function has no feature to identify a special window besides returning the region. So you might need some additional checks to be sure you are acting on the right window.

- Windows/Linux: The ``close()`` function currently kills the application, without closing it’s windows before. This is an abnormal termination and might be recognized by your application at the next start (e.g. Firefox usually tries to reload the pages).

- Even if the windows are hidden/minimized, their region that they have in the visible state is returned. Currently there is no Sikuli feature, to decide wether the given ``window(n)`` is visible or not or if it is currently the frontmost window. The only guarentee: ``window()``/``window(0) `` is the topmost window of an application (Mac) or a series of matching windows (Windows/Linux).

- Currently there are no methods available to act on such a window (resize, bring to front, get the window title, …).

Some tips:

- Check the position of a window’s returned region: some apps hide there windows by giving them “outside” coordinates (e.g. negative)

- Check the size of a window’s returned region: normally your app windows will occupy major parts of the screen, so a window’s returned region of e.g. 150x30 might be some invisible stuff or an overlay on the real app window (e.g. the “search in history” input field on the Safari Top-Sites page, which is reported as ``windows(0)``)

- If you have more than one application window, try to position them at different coordinates, so you can decide which one you act on in the moment.

- It is sometimes possible to use the OCR text extraction feature ``Region.text()`` to obtain the window title.

## Implementation Information

The following information on how the features are implemented might help to understand problematic situations or to make suggestions on enhancements.

- Windows

   - Applications are opened by internally running an appropriate ``start`` command.
   - The state of an application is evaluated by using the appropriate output of a ``tasklist`` command.
   - ``focus()`` and the window related features are still implemented at the native level (``WinUtil.dll``). Same goes for finding an application by part of its frontmost window’s title.

- Mac

   - Applications are opened by internally running an appropriate open command.
   - The state of an application is evaluated by using the output of an appropriate AppleScript snippet, internally run using macOS’s ``osascript`` command.
   - ``focus()`` and the window related features are still implemented at the native level (MacUtil.dll).

- Linux

   - The features are implemented by either running an appropriate shell command or by using appropriate features of the packages ``xdotool`` and ``wmctrl``, which must be provided by the user.
